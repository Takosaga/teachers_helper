# Teacher's Helper
[AI for Connectivity Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/ai-for-connectivity-hackathon) 

## Challenge

Teachers worldwide struggle to find high-quality, relevant teaching resources quickly. In low-resource communities, this challenge is amplified by limited internet access, outdated materials, and fragmented repositories. Educators spend hours curating lesson plans, worksheets, and activities instead of focusing on student engagement and innovation.

## Solution:

Teacher's Helper is a smart, adaptable platform that empowers educators to instantly discover and share teaching resourcesâ€”whether online or stored locally. Designed for flexibility, it can be deployed in the cloud for schools with reliable internet or installed on-premise in underserved communities, ensuring equitable access to educational materials.
